Welcome to VisiAr, the repository for Computer Vision demos.

These are Python demos with OpenCV, meaning you must have Python 3 and Python libraries OpenCV and Numpy.  You can install these two with pip (you'll need to install pip first):

    pip install numpy
    pip install opencv-contrib-python

pip is not mandatory, you can use any other package manager of your preference like conda.
